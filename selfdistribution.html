      <p>ITIS brings a full array of engineers and energy storage contractors throughout our network that specializes in the integration and operation of solar and renewable energy technologies.  Each holds diverse backgrounds in various means of power generation and energy storage methods, giving us a comprehensive network centered around solutions based synergy all focused on one main goal which is solving our client's energy needs one at a time.  Let's start with you.   Just give us a call today!</p>


      <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">ITIS Is Proud To Introduce The World's First Completely  Independent Self-Distributing Power Generation System - We Introduce "NewtonGen"    
        ​</h3>

        <h4>Groundbreaking NewtonGen Renewable Energy Technology</h4>
        <p>It is no doubt the world is quickly shifting towards green energy. All sectors of production are adopting green techniques to correspond to eco-friendly policies being adopted by governments across the globe. The power industry is one of the major industries that are putting up measures to transit from fossil fuels and nuclear energy to renewable energy like solar, wind, and water. But, despite massive investments and research to improve efficiency, reliability, and quantity of energy production from these sources, very little progress has been achieved. However, with NewtonGen’s innovation, this narrative will slowly fade into history books.</p>

        <h4>Nothing Worth Its Weight Happens Overnight, Neither Did the NewtonGen Nor Its Technology...</h4>
        <p>After years of research and testing, NewtonGen has developed a futuristic renewable energy technology that is poised to revolutionize the energy sector. The technology is independent of external sources like sun, wind, water, and fuels. Unlike Sun and Wind, which have an efficiency of less than 30 percent, the model boasts of over 90 percent efficacy. Furthermore, the maintenance-free technology with a lifespan of twenty years can be easily installed in the grid and off-grid. The technology does not require sophisticated protective gear and backup batteries; hence its installation is relatively affordable.</p>

        <h4>Best of Both Worlds - We've Combined the Power and Knowledge of Our network, With the Power Abilities of NewtonGen's Technology. You Get One Incredibly SMART Combination.</h4>

        <p>ITIS has partnered with NewtonGen to bring this new technology forward by offering it first to the general population by packaging it within our exclusive Micro-Grid systems combining them with EMS controllers, battery banks, and in some cases solar PV and/or another renewable generation source to complete a total generation system that can be independent or hybrid connected.  These systems can be ready-made or custom-built for both residential and commercial-scale projects.  We are confident that we can engineer a solution to satisfy most power usage and demand needs are, no matter the property dynamics and proportions.  We would love to talk to and share more details. Start by reviewing this video.  Give us try, and set up an evaluation today! </p>

        <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">WE CAN HELP TO MAKE COMPANIES GENERATE THEIR POWER </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center">Having an energy strategy is now a business mandate.</h4>
        <p>Data from a study done by the Rocky Mountain Institute shows that energy costs represent 30% of operating costs for the average business. We at ITIS can help our clients see a drastic reduction in that portion of operating their business. Utilizing a broader and strategic approach to commercial solar as a part of their energy strategy to streamline their overall energy costs. Our goal is to help you achieve maximum savings which can then be reinvested into making a big difference in the sustained growth of your core business.</p>

        <p>ITIS offers full-service and comprehensive turnkey energy solutions to meet your company's energy needs. We take the time to look at your property and thoroughly evaluate the best course of action to help you start saving from day one. With our network of statewide solar energy specialists teamed with knowledgeable technicians on your side, you can rest assured that you are partnering with the best in California.  

          ​</p>

          <p>Please keep in mind this is all brand new and using state of the art in current Technology, both pushing the brink of what has previously believed was possible to achieve for another 10 years or more.  The future is NOW. </p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Here is a similar product, that is also in pre-production stages, to give as a comparison</h4>

          <p>This generator doe not offer Bi-Directional functionality out-the-box, nor the HMI features and software that the NewtonGen has all built-in.  Furthermore, this competitor's unit COST even more.  Research yourself and find out why NewtonGen is a Game Changer.  The NewtonGen unit is getting closer to the market as we speak.  Call now for more details.
            ​</p>


            <h4>Let's Compare more Apples to Apples Shall we. How much electricity does a 10kW NewtonGen produce?</h4>

            <p>Example: NewtonGen 10 kW can generate on-demand renewable electricity 24/ 7/365 system requires no fossil fuels, sun, wind, or water.  Per day electricity result in kilowatt-hours: 192 kWh or 70080-kilowatt hours per year. A NewtonGen 10 kW would produce, 10kW × 365 days × 24 hours × 80% = 70080 kWh in a year. In this illustration, we show an 80% yield ratio or 8KWof usable power at any given moment.  Plus, depending on your configuration, our units are less to install and come out of the box programmed for Bi-Directional Net-Metering and with HMI touch screen modules that work seamlessly with most inverters, charge controllers, and Zigbee networks.</p>

            <p>There really is nothing else out there like the NewtonGen today.</p>
