Stay on the edge of what is happening by contributing and benefiting from the incentives currently available for solar energy producers.</p>

<h3>Solar panel incentives to consider:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The price of solar panels has fallen dramatically in the past decade - This is especially noteworthy when you consider how much more expensive electricity has become. These electrical companies are known for costly price hikes and they are becoming more and more frequent so take control of your power by consulting our San Francisco solar panel installation experts today.</li>
  <li>The cost of solar energy is relatively cheap compared against other sources - The monthly savings are becoming more robust each year. Some estimates are that you could save up to $20,000 over the course of a solar panel's lifetime. Savings depend on how much electricity you use and how many solar panels you install.</li>
  <li>Maintenance is minimal once installed but the returns are long-lasting - Our solar panels are state-of-the-art and require little to no maintenance. So outside of the price of installation, the cost to your pocketbook is next to nothing.</li>
  <li>Selling the energy you produce may provide more benefits - If you install enough solar panels, you can actually make enough energy to sell to the electrical grid. Turn a cost into a business by consulting our San Francisco solar panel installation experts today.</li>
  <li>The solar tax credit can significantly offset costs - The federal tax credit in 2020 is at 26% which means you can deduct 26% of the cost of installation from your federal taxes. In 2021 that number will be 22% and there is no set amount for 2022 so act now to save more.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Which Solar Power System Is Best for Your Home?</h3>
<p>Diamond Certified Bay Area Solar Company - Primary source of our statewide network partnerships are administered by IT Integrated Services, Inc.</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-bold">What is Diamond Certified?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A 12 step certification process</li>
  <li>Involves a survey of customers who have received service</li>
  <li>Companies must score above a certain threshold</li>
  <li>Companies must pass all credential-based ratings (insurances and state requirements)</li>
  <li>Companies are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure quality</li>
  <li>Companies commit to The Diamond Certified Performance Guarantee</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of solar system you require will largely depend upon the size of your home, your monthly energy needs, and your home's level of sun exposure. To get the maximum benefit out of your system, be sure to learn about whether your home has modernized electrical panels. Let our experts in (San Francisco, Inland Empire, San Diego, Los Angeles, Fresno, Palm Desert, San Fernando, and surrounding areas) solar power evaluate your California property and design a custom system that fits your needs and budget so you can start saving money.
