        ITIS offers full-service and comprehensive turnkey energy solutions to
        meet your company's energy needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many businesses and organizations, big and small, are looking for better
        provided, lower cost, and more reliable energy every day. They look at
        higher rising rates, and see political gauging, while many projects are
        completed by backdoor developer deals that finalized by large
        contractors soon long gone. Many businesses that want to make a change,
        just do not know where to go or whom to trust. What product is best to
        look for, will the company still be around, do they need batteries, can
        they still get any rebates or tax credits, are companies still willing
        to finance any projects right now, and the list of concerns goes on.
        Even though newer State legislations and local laws are geared to
        influence more corporate engagement in sustainable projects, the process
        can frustrate more than most causing many to still look the other way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, ITIS has made it even easier for businesses to have a
        reliable renewable replacement to the grid as your primary energy
        source. We come to you either in-person or online, we handle system
        engineering and design, all procurement, labor, and shipment
        coordination, along with all required inspections. From our first
        evaluation to the permits, we'll have you well informed and without the
        hassles. Similarly, most companies would offer to do the same, with one
        big difference. ITIS doesn't work for the Finance company, nor the
        installation team that sits behind the scene. We represent you, our
        client, and we have the means to replace any part of the equation that
        doesn't keep your project moving and set to our strictest standards.
        With you in the driver seat, as nothing moves forward without you first
        stating approval. Power made Easy, that is the strength of our network
        which is not available anywhere else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Give us a call, and see what makes us different from the other guys. We
        are sure you will see, we stick out from the crowd, and we offer a

      <p>
        Often times customers may find an offset in demand charges by the use of
        energy storage along with PV systems. Our solar professionals specialize
        in determining if having this type of arrangement will benefit your
        company's long-term goals. While evaluating your specific needs, we will
        surmise the best overall system which may include the use of PV panels,
        energy storage, ems configurations, and backup generators to create your
        own micro-grid if applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, we can also install solar EV charging stations for electric
        cars, allowing you to charge your vehicle using the power of the sun.
        Parking lot covers to give you more added solar coverage if that is
        required, and we also have specialized technology to provide large power
        to cover critical loads in very small spaces for those businesses that
        have high power demands with small footprints of space or that just want
        to generate their own power away from the grid in case of an emergency
        for disaster preparedness. Whatever your solar needs may be, our Diamond
        Certified solar installations can be part of the solution you need.
